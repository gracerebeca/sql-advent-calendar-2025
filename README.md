# SQL Advent Calendar 2025 🎄

This repository contains my solutions to the **24-day SQL Advent Calendar 2025** challenge hosted by Interview Master.

The challenge consists of one SQL problem released each day in December, designed to progressively strengthen real-world SQL skills through hands-on practice.


## About the Challenge

The SQL Advent Calendar is a festive, structured coding challenge that covers a range of SQL concepts, including:

- Data filtering and aggregation

Each day introduces a new problem with increasing complexity, encouraging consistency and deliberate practice.
